# MC Server Tracked Template

## What is this?
This repo contains a template that shows what I recommend tracking using [JaegyuDev/GoUpdater](https://github.com/JaegyuDev/GoUpdater) for minecraft servers.
This exists for 2 reasons:
1. it helps me manage things like the JDK/server startups
2. it allows others to push mods to the server, which gets synced to the client much in the same way that they do to the server.

For more info go to the previously mentioned repo.
